Developer notes - Arvid Haubold

I decided to change the annotated WebServlet to a Spring MVC configured application with a mixed normal MVC and Rest controller. This was due to the requirements of having a mixed endpoint (not sure if I would do this in an app). I came across some issues in the AngularJS code when retrieving the JSON from the /cakes endpoint after the first POST submit when adding a new record. Strangely enough after the first submit the list displayed fine on every subsequent submit. I therefore created a second REST endpoint /cakeList for the AngularJS client. The /cakes endpoint however still returns the json (when ran from Postman for instance).

I also felt that Spring will give more control for testing and when creating more endpoints or service methods. also I reckon there is no place for html served up by an application if not absolutely necessary.

I renamed the table to reflect the cake entity but left the hibernate sessionfactory in place due to time constraints but would suggest to change that to a pure JPA EntityManager and Repository implementation.
